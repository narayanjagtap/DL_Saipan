Let's break down the code step by step to understand what is happening.

### **1. Loading the Data and Preprocessing:**
```python
dataset = pd.read_csv("creditcard.csv")
dataset = dataset.drop("Time", axis=1)
dataset.Class.unique()
features = dataset.drop("Class", axis=1)
```
- **Loading Data**: The dataset `creditcard.csv` is loaded using `pandas`.
- **Removing the 'Time' column**: The "Time" column is dropped as it may not contribute meaningfully to the classification task.
- **Splitting the features and labels**: `features` stores all columns except for "Class", and the "Class" column (fraud vs normal) is separated as the target label.

### **2. Splitting Data into Train and Test:**
```python
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, dataset['Class'], random_state=2021)
```
- The data is split into training and test sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn`, with 30% of the data going to the test set (`TEST_PCT = 0.3`).

### **3. Selecting Fraudulent Transactions:**
```python
train_data = x_train.loc[y_train[y_train == 1].index]
```
- The training data (`x_train`) is filtered to include only the fraudulent transactions (where `y_train == 1`).

### **4. Scaling the Data:**
```python
minmax = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
x_train_scaled = minmax.fit_transform(train_data)
x_test_scaled = minmax.transform(x_test)
```
- The features are scaled to a range between 0 and 1 using `MinMaxScaler`. This is important for neural networks, as it ensures all inputs are in a similar scale.

### **5. Defining the Autoencoder Model:**
```python
class AutoEncoder(Model):
    def __init__(self, output_unit, ldim=8):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = Sequential([
            Dense(16, activation="relu"),
            Dropout(0.1),
            Dense(ldim, activation="relu")
        ])
        self.decoder = Sequential([
            Dense(16, activation="relu"),
            Dropout(0.1),
            Dense(output_unit, activation="sigmoid")
        ])
    def call(self, inputs):
        encoded = self.encoder(inputs)
        decoded = self.decoder(encoded)
        return decoded
```
- The **AutoEncoder** model is a neural network used to detect anomalies (fraudulent transactions in this case).
  - The **encoder** compresses the input into a lower-dimensional representation (`ldim`), which is 8 by default.
  - The **decoder** reconstructs the input from the lower-dimensional representation.
  - **Dropout layers** are added to prevent overfitting.

### **6. Compiling and Training the Model:**
```python
model = AutoEncoder(output_unit=x_train_scaled.shape[1])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss="msle", metrics=['mse'])
h = model.fit(x_train_scaled, x_train_scaled, validation_data=(x_test_scaled, x_test_scaled), epochs=20, batch_size=512)
```
- The **AutoEncoder** model is compiled with the **Adam optimizer** and **MSLE (Mean Squared Logarithmic Error)** as the loss function. The model is trained to reconstruct the input (autoencoding).
- The model is trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 512, using both training and validation data (for early stopping or checking performance during training).

### **7. Plotting the Training Losses:**
```python
plt.plot(h.history['loss'])
plt.plot(h.history['mse'])
plt.plot(h.history['val_loss'])
plt.plot(h.history['val_mse'])
plt.legend([ 'loss', 'val_loss'])
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('MSLE Loss')
plt.show()
```
- This code plots the training and validation loss (`loss` and `val_loss`) and mean squared error (`mse` and `val_mse`) over the epochs.

### **8. Finding the Threshold for Anomalies:**
```python
def find_threshold(model, x_train_scaled):
    recons = model.predict(x_train_scaled)
    recons_error = tf.keras.metrics.msle(recons, x_train_scaled)
    threshold = np.mean(recons_error.numpy()) + np.std(recons_error.numpy())
    return threshold
```
- This function calculates the reconstruction error on the training data. 
  - **MSLE** (Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) is used to measure the difference between the original and reconstructed data.
  - The threshold is determined as the **mean** of the reconstruction error plus the **standard deviation**, which will help in classifying data as normal or fraudulent.

### **9. Getting Predictions (Anomaly Detection):**
```python
def get_pred(model, x_test_scaled, threshold):
    pred = model.predict(x_test_scaled)
    error = tf.keras.metrics.msle(pred, x_test_scaled)
    AnomalyMask = pd.Series(error) > threshold
    return AnomalyMask.map(lambda x: 0.0 if x == True else 1.0)
```
- The model predicts the reconstruction error on the test set. 
- If the error is above the threshold, it's considered an **anomaly** (fraudulent transaction).
- The function returns `0` for fraudulent (anomaly) and `1` for normal transactions.

### **10. Applying Threshold and Predicting:**
```python
threshold = find_threshold(model, x_train_scaled)
pred = get_pred(model, x_test_scaled, threshold)
accuracy_score(pred, y_test)
```
- The threshold for anomalies is found using the training data.
- The predictions for the test set are obtained using the threshold, and the **accuracy score** is calculated by comparing these predictions with the true labels (`y_test`).

### **11. Final Evaluation:**
```python
accuracy_score(pred, y_test)
```
- The accuracy of the model on the test set is computed using **accuracy_score** from `sklearn`, which compares the predicted values (`pred`) against the true labels (`y_test`).

### **Summary of the Approach:**
- **Autoencoder** is used for anomaly detection. The model is trained to reconstruct normal transactions.
- The reconstruction error is used to identify anomalies, which in this case are fraudulent transactions.
- A **threshold** is calculated from the training data, and predictions are made on the test data by comparing reconstruction errors to this threshold.
