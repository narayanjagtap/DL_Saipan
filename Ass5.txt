Let's break down and explain each part of the code step by step:

### **1. Importing Required Libraries**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pylab as pylab
import numpy as np
import re
```
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: Libraries for creating visualizations like graphs and plots.
- **numpy**: Used for numerical operations, especially with arrays.
- **re**: Regular expression module for text processing.

### **2. Cleaning and Preprocessing the Text**
```python
sentences = """We are about to study the idea of computational proces. Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve. processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with out spells."""
```
- **sentences** is a multi-line string that contains the text to be processed.

```python
sentences = re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9]+',' ', sentences)
print(sentences)
```
- **re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9]+',' ', sentences)**: This regular expression replaces all non-alphanumeric characters (such as punctuation and special characters) with a space.

```python
sentences = re.sub(r'(?:^| )\w(?:$| )', ' ',sentences).strip()
print(sentences)
```
- **re.sub(r'(?:^| )\w(?:$| )', ' ',sentences)**: This removes all single-letter words (like "a" or "I") by replacing them with spaces.

```python
sentences = sentences.lower()
```
- Converts all the text to lowercase to maintain uniformity in the word representations.

### **3. Tokenizing the Text**
```python
words = sentences.split()
print(words)
```
- **split()**: Splits the text into a list of words.

### **4. Creating Vocabulary**
```python
vocab = set(words)
print(vocab)
```
- **set(words)**: Converts the list of words into a set to eliminate duplicates, creating the vocabulary.

```python
vocab_size = len(vocab)
embed_dim = 10
context_size = 2
```
- **vocab_size**: The size of the vocabulary (number of unique words).
- **embed_dim**: The dimension of the embedding space. This means each word will be represented by a 10-dimensional vector.
- **context_size**: The size of the context window (2 words before and 2 words after the target word).

### **5. Mapping Words to Indices**
```python
word_to_ix = {word: i for  i, word in enumerate(vocab)}
print(word_to_ix)

ix_to_word = {i: word for i, word in enumerate(vocab)}
print(ix_to_word)
```
- **word_to_ix**: A dictionary mapping each word to a unique index.
- **ix_to_word**: A dictionary mapping each index back to its corresponding word.

### **6. Creating the Training Data**
```python
data = []
for i in range(2, len(words)- 2):
    context = [words[i - 2],words[i - 1],words[i + 1],words[i + 2]]
    target = words[i]
    data.append((context, target))
print(data[:5])
print("length: ",len(data))
```
- **data**: A list of tuples containing the context (2 words before and 2 words after) and the target word.
- This is done for each word, except for the first two and last two words, as they don't have enough context.
- `data` is the training dataset, where each element is a pair of context words and the target word.

### **7. Initializing Word Embeddings**
```python
embeddings = np.random.random_sample((vocab_size, embed_dim))
```
- **embeddings**: A randomly initialized matrix of size `(vocab_size, embed_dim)`. Each row corresponds to a word in the vocabulary and is represented by a random vector of length `embed_dim`.

### **8. Defining Helper Functions**
```python
def linear(m, theta):
    w = theta
    return m.dot(w)
```
- **linear()**: A function that computes the linear transformation of the context words using the weight matrix `theta`.

```python
def log_softmax(x):
    e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))
    return np.log(e_x / e_x.sum())
```
- **log_softmax()**: A function that applies the log-softmax operation to the input, which is used for multi-class classification.

```python
def NLLLoss(logs, targets):
    out = logs[range(len(targets)), targets]
    return -out.sum() / len(out)
```
- **NLLLoss()**: Computes the negative log-likelihood loss for a multi-class classification task. It measures how well the predicted probabilities match the target labels.

```python
def log_softmax_crossentropy_with_logits(logits, target):
    out = np.zeros_like(logits)
    out[np.arange(len(logits)), target] = 1
    softmax = np.exp(logits) / np.exp(logits).sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    return (-out + softmax) / logits.shape[0]
```
- **log_softmax_crossentropy_with_logits()**: Computes the log-softmax cross-entropy loss. It combines the log-softmax and cross-entropy loss functions into one.

### **9. Forward Pass**
```python
def forward(context_idxs, theta):
    m = embeddings[context_idxs].reshape(1, -1)
    n = linear(m, theta)
    o = log_softmax(n)
    return m, n, o
```
- **forward()**: Given a list of context word indices, it performs a forward pass:
  - Retrieves the word embeddings for the context words.
  - Applies the linear transformation using `theta`.
  - Applies the log-softmax operation to get the output probabilities.

### **10. Backward Pass (Gradient Calculation)**
```python
def backward(preds, theta, target_idxs):
    m, n, o = preds
    dlog = log_softmax_crossentropy_with_logits(n, target_idxs)
    dw = m.T.dot(dlog)
    return dw
```
- **backward()**: Given the predictions and the target, it computes the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters `theta` and returns it.

### **11. Parameter Update (Optimization)**
```python
def optimize(theta, grad, lr=0.03):
    theta -= grad * lr
    return theta
```
- **optimize()**: Updates the parameters `theta` using the gradient `grad` and learning rate `lr`.

### **12. Training Loop**
```python
theta = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, (2 * context_size * embed_dim, vocab_size))
epoch_losses = {}
for epoch in range(80):
    losses = []
    for context, target in data:
        context_idxs = np.array([word_to_ix[w] for w in context])
        preds = forward(context_idxs, theta)
        target_idxs = np.array([word_to_ix[target]])
        loss = NLLLoss(preds[-1], target_idxs)
        losses.append(loss)
        grad = backward(preds, theta, target_idxs)
        theta = optimize(theta, grad, lr=0.03)
    epoch_losses[epoch] = losses
```
- **Training Loop**: Runs for 80 epochs:
  - For each context-target pair in the data, it performs a forward pass, computes the loss, performs the backward pass to calculate gradients, and updates the parameters using the `optimize()` function.

### **13. Plotting the Loss**
```python
ix = np.arange(0, 80)
fig = plt.figure()
fig.suptitle('Epoch/Losses', fontsize=20)
plt.plot(ix, [epoch_losses[i][0] for i in ix])
plt.xlabel('Epochs', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Losses', fontsize=12)
```
- **Plotting**: Plots the loss values over epochs to visualize how the loss decreases over time.

### **14. Prediction Function**
```python
def predict(words):
    context_idxs = np.array([word_to_ix[w] for w in words])
    preds = forward(context_idxs, theta)
    word = ix_to_word[np.argmax(preds[-1])]
    return word
```
- **predict()**: Given a list of context words, predicts the target word by finding the index with the highest probability.

### **15. Accuracy Calculation**
```python
def accuracy():
    wrong = 0
    for context, target in data:
        if(predict(context) != target):
            wrong += 1
    return(1 - (wrong / len(data)))
```
- **accuracy()**: Computes the accuracy of the model by comparing the predicted word with the actual target word for each context.

### **16. Final Accuracy and Prediction**
```python
accuracy()
predict(['processes', 'manipulate', 'things', 'study'])
```
- **accuracy()**: Prints the accuracy of the model.
- **predict()**: Predicts the target word for a given list of context words.

### **Summary:**
This code implements a **Word2Vec-like model** for predicting a word based on its context using an **autoencoder** architecture. The model learns embeddings for each word by minimizing
